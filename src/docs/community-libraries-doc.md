<!-- There are several contributions from the community that can be used in Vue-native and some of them are listed below : -->

## Icons

Usage of icons in Vue Native.

• Import and use the already available icons from the @expo/vector-icons for CRNA projects or react-native-vector-icons for non-crna projects (remember to link).
• Use PNGs as icons to get your own customized icons running.

Refer [here](http://staging-vue-native.geekydev.com/docs/community-libraries/icons.html) for more details.
