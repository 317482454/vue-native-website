## Open Development
All work on React happens directly on GitHub. Both core team members and external contributors send pull requests which go through the same review process.

## Your First Pull Request
Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this free video series:

## Sending a Pull Request
The core team is monitoring for pull requests. We will review your pull request and either merge it, request changes to it, or close it with an explanation. Weâ€™ll do our best to provide updates and feedback throughout the process.

Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from master.
2. Run npm install in the repository root.
3. Format your code with prettier
